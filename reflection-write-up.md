**Designing the API and Integrating Mock Services:**

To build the API for aggregating social media data, I used Node.js with Express.js to create two main features: one for combined stats from multiple platforms and another for detailed stats for a specific platform. I integrated with two mock APIs to simulate Twitter and Instagram data. Each API was handled by its own module, making the code cleaner and easier to manage. I used Axios to fetch data because it simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses.

**Challenges Faced and Solutions:**

1. **Dealing with API Failures:** Handling errors from the mock APIs was a major challenge. I solved this by adding error handling in the code to catch and manage any issues, ensuring users get clear error messages and the application remains stable.

2. **Caching Data:** To improve performance, I implemented caching to store API responses for 5 minutes. This meant the API doesn’t make too many requests to the mock services, which helps speed up the response time. I used `node-cache` for this, which required careful setup to make sure the cache updates correctly.

3. **Rate Limiting and Authentication:** Although not required, I considered adding rate limiting to prevent too many requests in a short time and thought about using API keys for authentication to secure access. These features were explored but not fully implemented in the final version.

4. **Writing Test Cases:** I found it challenging to write comprehensive test cases, particularly for ensuring that rate limiting, caching, and error handling scenarios were accurately covered. This required a lot of troubleshooting and adjustments to ensure the tests correctly simulated and validated the behavior of the API.

**Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Modular Design:** I split the API integration into separate modules for Twitter and Instagram. This made the code easier to maintain and update since each part handles a different API.

2. **Centralized Error Handling:** I set up a central place to manage errors in Express, which keeps the code organized and helps provide consistent error messages to users.

3. **Caching Strategy:** I chose to use caching to store responses temporarily. This improves performance by reducing the number of requests to the mock APIs and speeds up the API’s response time.

**Use of AI Tools:**

AI tools were helpful in guiding best practices for error handling and caching. They provided code suggestions and tips, making the development process smoother and ensuring the implementation was up to standard.

Overall, this project taught me a lot about designing APIs and handling data efficiently, focusing on clean code, error management, and performance improvements.
